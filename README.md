# Word Search :mag:
In a word search game, you are given a grid of letters and a list of words to find within the grid. These words can be arranged horizontally, vertically, and diagonally either forwards or backwards. This program implements a word search that finds words no matter how theyâ€™re arranged, even diagonally and backwards.
